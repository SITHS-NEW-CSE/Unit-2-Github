# Git and Git-Bash

When you're using Github Desktop, you're actually using an abstracted version of `git`, a command app/interface. Although Desktop makes it very easy for you to manage your Git repository, it is `git` that offers you the most power and versatility over the repo. When you truly understand how Git works, you'll only need `git` in your toolbox.

Linux users likely have `git` in the terminal already. MacOS and Windows users must install it externally (https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Basic Git Commands
You've probably already known how to copy or create new git repos in Github Desktop, but it's not half as hard on `git`:
```
($ = command; // = comment)

// make a new git repository
$ mkdir new_project
$ cd new_project
$ git init

```
