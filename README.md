# Fetching and Pulling from GitHub onto Desktop
When accessing a repository others have access to, they may push their changes onto that repo as well. If you want to access the changes someone makes to the repo, they
won't automatically appear in GitHub Desktop. <br> <br>

To access these changes, you will need to **Pull origin** in GitHub Desktop. This might not show up immediately, so you may need to **Fetch origin** to essentially
refresh the repo and see the changes that have been made and allow you to pull them. Fetching should happen automatically when switching onto repo in desktop.

# Using Branches
When working on a project you may want to have multiple versions of your projects in various states, particularly if you're collaborating on a project and your team
members are working on different parts of the project. The way to have this version control is through the use of branches. <br> <br>

Branches are created based on pre-existing branches, copying over any code that already existed in them, however any changes made after that will only be made on that
branch, not affecting other branches. <br> <br>

To create a branch in desktop, click on the "Current branch" drop down and then click on "New branch." This will allow you to name your branch as well as choose the
existing branch it's based on. You can also use this drop down to switch between branches that exist in your repo. Each new branch that you create on desktop will need
to be published to GitHub for others to be able to access.
