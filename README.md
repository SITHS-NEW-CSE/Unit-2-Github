# Saving a repository to Desktop
When accessing a repository (repo) on GitHub, there will be a green button with a download icon and the word "Code" on it. When you click on that button there will 
be a button that says "Open with GitHub Desktop." When you choose to open with desktop, GitHub Desktop will ask if you want to clone the repo. Click the clone button
and you're done.

# Using GitHub Desktop
GitHub desktop will connect to your default code editor, in this case being Visual Studio Code. <br> <br>
Whenever you write something in vscode, it will update as an edit in GitHub Desktop. <br> <br>
When there are edits stored in GitHub Desktop, you will be able to **commit** your changes, which will locally save the changes you made. <br> <br>
You can commit as many times as you want to save locally. You will have the ability to access and revert to past commits, so it's recommended to commit often. <br> <br>
When you're ready to publish your code to GitHub so it can be accessed from multiple devices, you will **push origin**. If you created your repo in desktop, you
will need to publish the repo first. <br>
<br>
You can create a new repo by clicking the "Current repository" tab, clicking "Add" next to the "Filter" search bar, and the clicking "Create new repository..."
